### Tips 

Try exprimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>` `==`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in vargrant. 

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availabletime` inside your function, try outputing their values to the Terminal as follows


``` javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availabletime) {
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("avalabletime is", availabletime);

}
```
